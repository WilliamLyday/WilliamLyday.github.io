        Hello, my name is William Lyday, this is a example portfolio page.

    <h1>HigherLower game</h1>
    <p>
    Goal: Write a number guessing game, where a number is chosen between 1 and<br>
    100. The user guesses, the game indicates higher, lower, or correct. The user<br>
    continues to guess until correct. The score is always displayed as well as a top 10<br>
    high scores list. If just finished game's score was within the top 10, this<br>
    score should be displayed within that list.
    </p>

    <h2>Additional Requirements:</h2> 
    <p>
    Must support SSL/TLS certificates to provide secure connection<br>
    Needs a typical login (sign up with new/existing)<br>
    Needs a db to store user login data<br>
    Needs a db to store all time high scores data<br>
    Must have crptographically hashed password with unique salting at account creation<br>

    <h1>Hangman game</h1>
    <p>Goal: Create a similar web stack application as the number guessing game,<br>
        except now it's the game of hangman.  The game itself should be played using an asynchronous UI<br>
        A guess should not be redirected/posted/getted to a new page which generates a new next phase page<br>
        Either use AJAX (client side directed asynchronous) or use websockets. Self/Free hosting are options.
    </p>

    <h2>Additional Requirements:</h2> 
    <p>
    Must support SSL/TLS certificates to provide secure connection<br>
    Needs a typical login (sign up with new/existing)<br>
    Needs a db to store user login data<br>
    Needs a db to store all time high scores data<br>
    Must have crptographically hashed password with unique salting at account creation<br>
    Must use a different stack; You can choose .NET or Java, but don't use a stack 3+ years old<br>

    <h1>Speed Card game</h1>
    <p>Goal: Create an application in which two different sessions can connect (such as two different browsers<br>
        on the same computer, or two different computers) and play the game of speed with each other. Game<br>
        logic is: Shuffle a 52 card deck.  Deal 20 cards to both players.  Make 4 piles in the middle<br>
        of the table with 5, 1, 1, 5 cards in each central pile respectively from left to right.  The central middle<br>
        piles get flipped face up and each player draws up to 5 cards at any point from their piles of 20.<br>
        The goal is to place cards on the two central middle piles until the 20 card player deck is fully depleated.<br>
        The first player to completely get rid of their 20 card deck wins.  Cards can only be placed on the face up cards in<br>
        the middle if their value is +1 or -1 the face value of the middle cards, regardless of suite.  (ie 3 of<br>
        diamonds can be played on 2 of spades or 4 of hearts). In the case neither player has a valid move the piles of 5<br>
        on the sides in the middle are the reserve being flipped over and giving a new set of playable central cards.
    </p>

    <h2>Additional Requirements:</h2> 
    <p>
        The game must be visual and use visual card images.<br>
        An integer should display indicating the total number of cards left in each player's deck.<br>
        The game must display the winner on both screens when complete.<br>
        Upon completing the game, the players must be given the choice to play again.<br> 
        Play resumes if both vote yes.<br>
        Game must be mobile UI friendly.<br>
        The game must have a different shuffle of cards each game play.<br>
        The game must work within different browsers and be asynchronous,<br>
        using websockets to transmit data back and forth via a server.
