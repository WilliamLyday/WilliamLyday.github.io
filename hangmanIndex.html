    <h1>Hangman game</h1>
    <p>Goal: Create a similar web stack application as the number guessing game,<br>
        except now it's the game of hangman.  The game itself should be played using an asynchronous UI<br>
        A guess should not be redirected/posted/getted to a new page which generates a new next phase page<br>
        Either use AJAX (client side directed asynchronous) or use websockets. Self/Free hosting are options.
    </p>

    <h2>Additional Requirements:</h2> 
    <p>
    Must support SSL/TLS certificates to provide secure connection<br>
    Needs a typical login (sign up with new/existing)<br>
    Needs a db to store user login data<br>
    Needs a db to store all time high scores data<br>
    Must have crptographically hashed password with unique salting at account creation<br>
    Must use a different stack; You can choose .NET or Java, but don't use a stack 3+ years old<br>
